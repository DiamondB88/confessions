# CONFESSIONS    

> A full CRUD app allowing a user express anything in secracy. Everyone has thoughts they wish they could tell someone but may be afraid of what others will think; well on Confessions you can express anything that comes to mind without the worry of being judged by others because you confess anonymusly.

##  New technical challenge I taught myself

> With having the challenge of teaching myself something new with my final project I found myself searching online for new techniques and came across the idea to use a recaptcha. Recaptchas are used widely across websites with forms and I thought it would be useful to learn how to implement recaptcha within a form. I found this to be quite more difficult than expected but with the extra help with a final step from Jerrica I was able to get this completed. 

## Technical Details Used

> For this final project I decided to use the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) because I was very comfortable with this language coming out of unit 3's lesson. I wanted to see what I could build alone with the knowledge after working in a group project with Angular.

## Technical Challenges

> In contrary to the above statement, I also found this to be a challenge. I went with MEAN stack because of the comfort level however after an intense week with React in between the 2 projects and not fully understanding what had just took place within that week, I found what I thought I knew very well had disappeared from my mind. I actually had to fall back on notes from class quite a bit in the beginning to get started but once I got past the setup I had a great flow going with exception of trying to create an extra extravagent masterpiece in such a short time frame. 

## Future Improvements

> If I had more time this would be more like a real facebook app with the exception of a log in feature. A user will be able to edit only their confession, users can comment on other users confessions and there would be an option to search by category. I would also fix a few things with styling within the divs that hold the confessions.
